# Active Agent Handoff

**Status:** READY
**Last updated:** 2026-08-08
**Current active agent:** None
**Next agent:** Any authorized Shadecode agent

## Current Project State

No implementation task is currently claimed by this handoff file. The repository contains the active product code, Cortex system, task roadmap, audits, architecture documentation, and the new multi-agent coordination protocol.

## Required Starting Point

Before claiming work, read:

1. `README.md`
2. `docs/AGENT_COORDINATION_PROTOCOL.md`
3. `docs/AGENT_HANDOFF_TEMPLATE.md`
4. `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md`
5. the latest applicable audit documents in `docs/`
6. `docs/BLUEPRINT_GAP_MATRIX.md`
7. `.cortex/tasks.md`
8. relevant open PRs/issues

Then inspect the actual code affected by the proposed task.

## Important Rules

- Do not assume old chat prompts are current.
- Do not bypass existing blueprints, audits, or task constraints.
- Do not claim tests passed unless they were run.
- Do not put credentials in repository files.
- Use a dedicated branch and reviewable PR for implementation changes.
- Update this file before handing work to another agent.

**Exception:** Claude commits directly to `main` for its own work, per explicit owner decision -- see `docs/decisions/ADR-2026-08-08-001-claude-direct-to-main.md`. This does not apply to other agents unless the owner records the same exception for them.

## Current Ownership

No task is claimed. The next agent must explicitly claim a task and populate the handoff before beginning substantial implementation work.

## Open Questions

None recorded here. Task-specific questions belong in the active handoff state.
